Over the last few weeks a number of UK Labour politicians are being investigated after alleged racist posts on social media. At least [three more councillors have been suspended today](http://Take%20a%20look%20at%20@richferrer%27s%20Tweet:%20https://twitter.com/richferrer/status/727177828299579393?s=09). I don’t know how many have been found to have breached Labour’s rules.

Labour have responded by setting up [an independent inquiry into racism within the party](http://press.labour.org.uk/post/143593428989/jeremy-corbyn-launches-action-plan-on-tackling) and are suspending people whilst investigations take place.

Politicians are probably being scrutinised by their opponents rather than their party or their voters. The problem is not limited to alleged racist comments. Scrutiny tends to happen only when political parties can use it to their advantage rather than when it helps voters. There is another way.

One that should increase trust in our political system and will help open up politics.

#### Open government and open politicians

Most voters expect more transparency and openness from politicians than we do from other people. We have decided that it is in the public interest for governments and politicians to be more open.

The Panama Papers reopened the debate over how [open our politicians should be about their financial affairs](https://medium.com/@peterkwells/panama-open-data-personal-data-open-panama-a402fd1a154d) but the clear trend is towards open government and open politicians.

Voters make decisions on who they elect and give power to. We want to trust politicians. We want to know who politicians are, what their experience is and how they make decisions.

Nowadays many of us want politicians to be on the social media platforms that we are on. Some people expect Facebook and Twitter, other people might expect Snapchat or Instagram. We expect to hear their views, to ask questions and ([if they have time](https://medium.com/@peterkwells/politicians-should-open-up-casework-data-217af078a8a7#.47a8d8nb2)) to get a response.

Politicians can choose not to join those platforms, or to have a private profile, but we expect to hear their reasons why and voters will decide based on what they see.

#### Open politician data

In the UK a number of people work to help us make better decisions about politicians by giving us better and non-partisan information. [Full Fact](https://fullfact.org/) provide an independent fact-checking service. [MySociety](https://www.mysociety.org/) helps us understand how politicians vote. [Democracy Club](https://democracyclub.org.uk/) help us know what elections we can vote in, where we can vote and [_who we can vote for_](https://whocanivotefor.co.uk/).

Democracy Club and a team of volunteers have crowdsourced the details of every UK politician standing in this year’s elections. In many cases they have gathered their homepage, email address, Facebook page and Twitter name. The [data is published as open data](https://candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/help/api), [anyone can use it for any purpose](http://theodi.org/what-is-open-data).

#### Open politician data helps scrutiny

As well as helping individual voters know who they can vote for this dataset provides a way to scrutinise political candidates.

If I was so inclined I could automate a search for content posted by those politicians that match certain keywords and pass the results to a crowd to investigate the details before challenging people who said things that we think are wrong. That might be a potentially racist comment or it might be a flaw in a CV.

This might sound scary but it is not very different to our politicians demanding that [social media firms find ways to spot terrorist activity on their platforms](http://www.govtech.com/social/Potential-for-Helping-Spot-Terrorists-on-Social-Media-is-Huge.html). To achieve that aim technology firms will have to scrutinise all of us. We expect more transparency from our politicians than we do from other people.

#### Political parties should be open

All major UK political parties say they support open government and open data. But Democracy Club had to crowdsource a list of the details of every candidate standing in this year’s election because that list is not published by UK government or by our political parties.

They are not practising what they preach. In a modern democracy we should not have to crowdsource data about politicians, the data should be open for all of us to use.

Political parties should choose to publish open data about politicians or even people standing for positions within their party. The data should include their names, their CVs and their public social media profiles. The data should be [published as open data](http://theodi.org/guides/publishers-guide-open-data-licensing). Politicians can still choose to have private social media accounts. Voters will decide based on the information available to them.

If politicians, candidates or elected officials are challenged because of their views then the results of the investigation- whether it be guilty or not guilty-should be published for all voters to see

This open data will allow us to scrutinise candidates before they are elected and to hold them account afterwards. It will help voters, whether it be for internal party elections or ones that we can all vote in, make more informed decisions. It will also help us work out who we can vote for.

Increased scrutiny will not make our world a utopia (spoiler: nothing will) but it will happen earlier, it will be performed by more people, and the results will be available to more voters. It will create better debate. It will help democracy, political parties and voters.

Voters might still decide to vote for a [racist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Griffin), or discover they voted for someone who [was a racist](http://Nazi%20stag-do%20Tory%20MP%20Aidan%20Burley%20to%20step%20down%20-%20http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-26059862), but at least it will be a more informed decision. Driving racists out of politics, making more informed decisions and encouraging more openness seems to fit what UK society and voters want. It certainly fits what I want, but I know my standards may be different to others. Perhaps debating what we learn will help us understand what UK society really wants for openness, for privacy and from our politicians.

Political parties tell us they believe in open politics and open data, it’s time for them to deliver data on their own candidates.
