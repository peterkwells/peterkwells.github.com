Hello. This is the personal website of Peter Wells. It is mostly used for blogposts.

I am Director of Public Policy at the [Open Data Institute (ODI)](https://theodi.org).

In 2014 I worked in a voluntary role to organise an independent review of digital government policy for the UK Labour Party.

Previously I spent 20 years working with telecoms businesses and regulators in multiple countries.  

I'm a big fan of Blackpool FC and was once, and only once, told I had impeccable taste in music.
